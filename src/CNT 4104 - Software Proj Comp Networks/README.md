Remotely-Controlled Catapult
==========================================================================
The objective of this project is to apply the fundamentals of an embedded system to remotely control a catapult, launching small-scale projectiles via an Android device. The catapult project will fulfill a need to effectively reduce user intervention, such that the user wonâ€™t have to manually retract or lock the catapult arm into place but will only be required to reload the device. 

Android Application Source Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executable file (.apk) for the Android application, which provides input to the Arduino through button clicks. The Android application also displays system state when the device is not connected to a Bluetooth device or when a button click event is handled.

Arduino Source Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Arduino source code, written in a C based language, continually listens for input from the Android application and determines the behavior exhibited by each micro-servo on the catapult hardware.
