Remotely-Controlled Catapult
==========================================================================
The objective of this project is to apply the fundamentals of an embedded system to remotely control a catapult, launching small-scale projectiles via an Android device. The catapult project will fulfill a need to effectively reduce user intervention, such that the user wonâ€™t have to manually retract or lock the catapult arm into place but will only be required to reload the device.
