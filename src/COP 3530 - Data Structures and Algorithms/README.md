COP 3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms
====================================================
Data structure design, implementation, application, and analysis are explored. Abstract data types (ADTs) are
introduced and use of interfaces is emphasized. Topics include stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
Recursion is revisited, functions as data is considered, and computational complexity of searching and
sorting algorithms are explored.
